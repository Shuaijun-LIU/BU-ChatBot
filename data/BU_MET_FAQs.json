        "question": "What is the difference between a Graduate Certificate and a Master's Degree program?",
        "answer": "A graduate certificate program is made up of 16 credits (4 courses) in a specific subject area. The completion of the coursework typically indicates the mastering of this specific subject area. Certificates are generally meant for students who are looking to improve their knowledge within a chosen area.\n\nA Master’s Degree program leads to an academic degree. Students are required to take a set of core courses that offer a solid advanced understanding of the discipline and then can choose to focus their study in one specific area by declaring a concentration.\n\nStudents may take a graduate certificate in conjunction with a related master’s degree program."

    {
        "module": "Programs",
        "question": "Can I tailor my study to one or more areas?",
        "answer": "Our programs provide students opportunities to tailor their course of study to meet their particular goals through electives, predefined course alternatives, and concentrations. Students who are currently enrolled in a master’s degree program have the option to take a related certificate program in conjunction with their degree program, without reapplication. Please contact your designated program administrator for further details."

        "question": "Is the online degree held to the same academic regard as the on campus degree?",
        "answer": "Yes, the online and on campus degrees both have been created with strict attention to maintaining a high academic standard. The main differences are the way the courses are offered and that online courses are more intense, being seven weeks long instead of fourteen weeks. Students can take courses online, on campus or in a blended format, where students participate online and come to campus five times during the semester. All required MSCIS and MSSD courses are available online. A few general elective courses may only be available on campus."
