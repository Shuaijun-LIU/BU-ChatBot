This year of U.S. work permission is called Optional Practical Training (OPT).\nStudents in certain Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) majors, may qualify for a 24-month extension of OPT. Eligibility for a\nSTEM OPT\n, as well as the application process, and the requirements for STEM OPT employment, are different than those outlined below for OPT.\nOPT Eligibility\nAs an F-1 student you are eligible for up to 12 months of OPT authorization for each academic level. You can choose to start using your OPT time after you have been enrolled for one full academic year, but many students choose to save your OPT year for after graduation.\nYou may earn a new year of OPT eligibility if you move to a\nhigher\nlevel of education in the U.S. (for instance, from a Bachelor’s to a Master’s degree), but not if you move to a new program at the same or lower level.\nYou may be eligible to apply for OPT if:\nYou hold valid F-1 status\nYou have been lawfully enrolled as a full-time college/university student for at least one full academic year (two full semesters)\nYou are in good academic standing with Boston University\nYou may NOT qualify to apply for OPT if:\nAll or part of your last academic year was spent in an English-language training program, including BU’s Center for English Language and Orientation Programs (CELOP)\nYou were previously authorized for 12 months of more of\nfull-time\nCurricular Practical Training (CPT); part-time CPT does not affect your eligibility for OPT\nYou have previously received OPT authorization for the same or higher educational level\nIf you are on a leave of absence or suspension from BU\nYou have had violation or break in F-1 status in the past academic year, and have restarted your F-1 status by travel with a new “initial” I-20\nIn order to count summer as a “full semester” towards OPT and CPT eligibility, you must be enrolled for 12 credits or both summer terms. While 8 credits in one summer term is usually considered “full-time” registration, this is not considered a “full semester” of study for the purpose of employment eligibility.\nKeep in mind that an ISSO advisor will review your academic record and your immigration history to evaluate whether we can recommend you for a period of OPT. The final decision on whether to approve your case is made by USCIS.\nPart-Time and Full-Time\nWhen you apply for OPT, you must indicate if you are requesting permission for part-time or full-time OPT.\nPart-time\nauthorization allows you to work up to 20 hours per week, while\nfull-time\nauthorization is required if you will work more than 20 hours per week.\nYou can apply for periods of OPT authorization as follows:\nPart-time during a regular semester of study\nPart-time or full-time during summer vacation\nPart-time or full-time if you are a graduate student done with all course work and completing the thesis or dissertation stage of your degree\nFull-time to begin after graduation\nIf you apply for part-time authorization, it will be deducted from your 12 month total at half the rate. For instance, if you apply for 4 months of part-time OPT, you have used the equivalent of 2 months of full-time OPT and are still eligible to apply for your remaining 10 months.\nTypes of OPT\nPre-Completion\nYou can apply to begin using your OPT time once you have been enrolled for one full academic year (two full semesters), and while you are still completing your program of study. Pre-completion OPT is available part-time only during semesters of required study, but you can choose either part-time or full-time during summer vacation periods or if you are in the thesis or dissertation stage of a graduate degree.\nPost-Completion\nYou may wish to save all or most of your 12 months of OPT eligibility to use after your completion of your program of study. You must be registered for graduation or have a letter from your academic department verifying the date of expected completion of the program of study when applying for OPT.\nWhen should I Apply for OPT?\nOPT applications must be received by USCIS within a specific filing window in order to be considered. Application received before or after the filing window will likely be denied by USCIS.\nWe recommend that students apply for OPT as soon as they are able as it can take 90 days or longer for the USCIS to reach a decision on the application.\nUSCIS will accept applications for OPT up to 90 days before your program end date (for post-completion OPT), or up to 90 days before the requested OPT start date (for pre-completion OPT).\nApplications must arrive at USCIS no later than 30 days after the OPT recommendation is made on your I-20 by an ISSO advisor.\nApplications must arrive at USCIS no later than the end of the 60 day grace period after the program end date. Applications arriving this late may not be approved for the full 12-months of eligibility.\nStudent On-Campus Employment\nStudent Off-Campus Work (CPT, OPT, STEM)\nCurricular Practical Training (CPT) (F-1)\nOptional Practical Training (OPT) (F-1)\nApplying for OPT\nResolving Common OPT Issues\nOPT Employment Types\nMaintaining F-1 Status during OPT\nEmployer Address Reporting\n24-Month STEM OPT\nSEVP Portal\nCap Gap\nAcademic Training (AT) (J-1)\nEconomic Hardship\nResearcher, Faculty, and Staff Employment\nI-9 Employment Eligibility Verification\nSocial Security Numbers\nUS Tax Information\nVolunteering\nForms\nApplication Checklist for OPT\nApplication Checklist for STEM OPT Extension\nHelpful Links\nPayroll Office (BU Employees)\nStudent Employment Office\nOffice of the University Registrar\nUniversity Service Center\nStudent Central\nOffice of Housing\nOffice of Housing Resources, Medical Campus\nWelcome, New Students!\nRiho Imada (from left) and Akari Noguchi, both students at the Center for English Language and Orientation Programs, and Andrew Burwash (CAS'18) at the International Student Reception, held September 4 at the Trustee Ballroom.\nPhoto by Jackie Riccardi\nISSO News\nSpring 2024 Workshops\nJanuary 12, 2024\nSpring 2024 Student Reminders\nJanuary 10, 2024\nUSCIS Premium Processing Fee Increases\nJanuary 3, 2024\nISSOPortal is Live for Student Immigration Processing!\nNovember 27, 2023\nReminders for F-1 Students Graduating in January\nOctober 5, 2023\nBU Global News\nDispatches from Abroad: International Students on Life at Home\nApril 17, 2020\nStudy Abroad Program Directors on Coping with Coronavirus, Far from Boston\nApril 17, 2020\nFrederick S.

In some cases, the required credit hours for your degree program may exceed the 12 credit hours required for immigration purposes.\nGraduate Students = 12 Credit Hours*\n*Graduate students with teaching or research responsibilities:\nExceptions are made for doctoral level graduate students who are assigned teaching or research responsibilities pursuant to the\nterms\nof a full teaching assistantship, teaching fellowship, or research assistantship requiring 20 hours of work per week. In this case, you must register and be officially certified full time by your academic department.\n*Graduate students who have completed all required coursework:\nIf a thesis or dissertation is required of your doctoral program of study and you have completed all required coursework, you need only register for the number of hours of thesis or dissertation research recommended by your academic advisor. In addition, you must register and be officially certified full time by your academic department.\nNon-Degree Students = 12 Credit Hours\nAt the beginning of each semester, the ISSO is required to confirm that all international students are maintaining full-time enrollment. Student enrollment continues to be monitored throughout the semester. Students who drop below full-time enrollment without prior authorization from the ISSO must be reported to the Department of Homeland Security via\nSEVIS\n. As a result, the student will lose lawful\nF-1\nor\nJ-1\nstatus including employment eligibility and benefits.\nInternational students in a status other than F-1 or J-1 do not have the same minimum registration requirements. Please consult with the ISSO to discuss any registration requirements or limitations based on your specific immigration classification.\nOnline Course Restrictions\nFederal student immigration regulations only allow for one 4-credit class to count towards the minimum full-time enrollment requirement of 12 credits.  Therefore, F-1 and J-1 students must be careful when registering for online coursework.  If a student enrolls for 12 credits, they are only permitted to enroll in one 4-credit online course per semester. If a student enrolls for 16 credits, they may be eligible to enroll in two online courses per semester.  Blended and hybrid class formats are counted the same as online classes and therefore, the same restrictions apply.\nRegulatory Exceptions that Qualify for a Reduced Courseload (RCL)\nImmigration regulations permit exceptions to the full-time enrollment requirement in very limited circumstances. You must request and obtain a reduced courseload authorization through the\nISSOPortal\nfrom the ISSO\nprior\nto dropping below full-time enrollment. The ISSO\ncannot\nretroactively authorize a drop below full-time enrollment, so please\ncontact\nthe ISSO before you drop or withdraw from classes. Students may be authorized for an exception and approved for an authorized reduced courseload (RCL) for the following reasons:\nReduced\nEnrollment\nfor\nAcademic\nReasons\nAcceptable academic reasons for dropping below full-time enrollment include improper course level placement, initial difficulties with the English language and/or reading requirements, or unfamiliarity with American teaching methods.\nYou must provide a letter of assessment from your academic counselor that verifies the circumstances and recommends that you be allowed to take less than a full-time credit load for the semester.\nAuthorization for reduced enrollment due to initial difficulties with the English language and/or reading requirements or unfamiliarity with American teaching methods may only be authorized during the first semester of study.\nOnce you have sufficient documentation, log into the\nISSOPortal\nand select the\nI-20 Reduced Course Load\nto upload required documentation and request approval in advance of the start of the applicable semester or before you make any changes to your registration status\n.\nReduced\nEnrollment\nfor Final Semester\nDegree-seeking students in\nF-1\nor\nJ-1\nstatus may be authorized to drop below full-time enrollment in their final semester, if they will\ncomplete all program requirements\nby the end of that semester.\nProof of expected graduation is required in order to request RCL authorization. Before requesting authorization for reduced courseload during your final semester, you should register for graduation with your school or college so that the anticipated graduation is reflected in your student record. Alternately, you may obtain a letter from your academic advisor, director of graduate studies, or dean of the school/college verifying that you need only a part-time courseload to complete your program in the current term.\nYou must be registered for at least one “in-person” class on campus in your final semester as you are not permitted to enroll in only online courses in your final semester.\nOnce you have taken the appropriate action with your school or college, log into the\nISSOPortal\nand select the\nI-20 Reduced Course Load\nto upload required documentation and request approval in advance of the start of the applicable semester or before you make any changes to your registration status\n.\nIf you are requesting a Reduced Courseload in your final semester and need ISSO’s approval to drop a class, please follow instructions to upload the Registrar’s\nAdd/Drop Form\nthrough the portal.\nPlease note that it can take up to 10 business days to process this request.\nReduced\nEnrollment\nfor Medical Reasons\nStudents may be authorized to drop below full-time enrollment due to\nphysical or mental health reasons\n. (Complete withdrawal from courses is also permitted, if necessary.)\nStudents must provide documentation from a medical doctor, doctor of osteopathy, or a licensed clinical psychologist recommending a reduced courseload due to illness or medical condition. The letter must also specify the time period recommended for the reduced enrollment.\nAuthorization for reduced enrollment for medical reasons cannot exceed a cumulative period of 12 months during the student’s degree program.\nAuthorization for reduced enrollment for medical reasons can only be given one semester at a time, therefore continuing health issues may require more than one authorization.\nOnce you have sufficient documentation, log into the\nISSOPortal\nand select the\nI-20 Reduced Course Load\nto upload required documentation and request approval in advance of the start of the applicable semester or before you make any changes to your registration status\n.\nAudited\nCourses,\nIncomplete Courses, and Missing Grades\nAudited (“AU”) courses\ndo not count toward the credit requirements for a full course of study.\nIncomplete (“I”) courses\nare permissible, so long as you are eligible to continue in your program and remain enrolled for a full course of study while you make up incomplete work. Makeup work cannot be counted toward full-time enrollment in subsequent semesters. To stay in lawful immigration status, you must complete all work and receive a final grade for any incomplete courses by the end of your final semester of study.\nReceiving a\nmissing grade (“MG”)\nin any course usually indicates that you stopped attending the course and that a grade cannot be given. Courses for which you receive an “MG” grade will not be counted toward your full-time enrollment.\nSummer Term\nRegistration\nSummer enrollment may or may not be required—it depends on your situation. You are required to register for classes during the summer\nif\n:\nYou will\nbegin a new program of study\nor return to study after a\nleave of absence or suspension\nduring the Summer Term.\nDegree Students:\nIf your begin a new program in the summer and your immigration document was issued to begin in late May, you must register for at least 12 credits over the entire Summer Term. If your immigration document was issued to begin in late June or early July, you must register for at least 8 credits. (Graduate students may register for fewer credit hours only if they are certified full time by their academic department.)\nNon-Degree Summer Term Students:\nIf your immigration document was issued for 6 weeks of study, you must register for at least 8 credits. If it was issued for 12 weeks of study, you must register for at least 12 credits over the entire Summer Term.\nYou will\ncomplete your program of study\nduring the Summer Term.\nImmigration Overview\nYour Immigration Documents\nMaintaining Status\nYour SEVIS Record\nYour ISSOPortal\nFull-Time Enrollment Requirement\nProgram Extension\nChange of Program/Appointment Information\nInterruptions to your Program, Employment, or Affiliation\nChange of Personal Information\nChange of Address\nJ-1 Bars and Restrictions\nPublic Charge\nFamily Matters\nHelpful Links\nPayroll Office (BU Employees)\nStudent Employment Office\nOffice of the University Registrar\nUniversity Service Center\nStudent Central\nOffice of Housing\nOffice of Housing Resources, Medical Campus\nWelcome, New Students!\nRiho Imada (from left) and Akari Noguchi, both students at the Center for English Language and Orientation Programs, and Andrew Burwash (CAS'18) at the International Student Reception, held September 4 at the Trustee Ballroom.\nPhoto by Jackie Riccardi\nISSO News\nSpring 2024 Workshops\nJanuary 12, 2024\nSpring 2024 Student Reminders\nJanuary 10, 2024\nUSCIS Premium Processing Fee Increases\nJanuary 3, 2024\nISSOPortal is Live for Student Immigration Processing!\nNovember 27, 2023\nReminders for F-1 Students Graduating in January\nOctober 5, 2023\nBU Global News\nDispatches from Abroad: International Students on Life at Home\nApril 17, 2020\nStudy Abroad Program Directors on Coping with Coronavirus, Far from Boston\nApril 17, 2020\nFrederick S.
