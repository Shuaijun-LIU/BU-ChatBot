The completion of the coursework typically indicates the mastering of this specific subject area. Certificates are generally meant for students who are looking to improve their knowledge within a chosen area.\nA Master\u2019s Degree program leads to an academic degree. Students are required to take a set of courses core courses that offer a solid advanced understanding of the discipline and then can choose to focus their study in one specific area by declaring a concentration.\nStudents may take a graduate certificate in conjunction with a related master\u2019s degree program.",

RSVP here: https://www.facebook.com/events/1500657180246663/ Talk Topic: Surviving the Microservices Revolution at Yelp Tuesday, October 6th, 2015 5:30pm-6:30pm MCS 148 111 Cummington Mall, Boston MA 02215 Talk abstract: Have you heard of microservices? They’re all the rage these days. Everyone’s blogging about ‘em. The idea is straightforward: take a big web app; split it up into smaller apps; profit. Easy, right? In practice, there are a lot of functional, technical, and cultural challenges to overcome when going from one to many. Come hear Alex L. speak about microservices vs. monoliths, some common pitfalls of all distributed systems, and what Yelp has learned from over two years of building, testing, and deploying a service-oriented architecture. At our tech talk, we’re providing food and drinks from El Pelon Taqueria, and raffling off an iPad Mini w/Retina, so remember to bring your CS or engineering resume to get a raffle ticket!"
